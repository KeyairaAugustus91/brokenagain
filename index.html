             the park. Oh! you want to know about the techincal stuff. ok! First, other
             than being a libra, I am an actress, I discovered my love for the theater before
             I hit the stage. As a little girl, I loved effecting peoples feels by altering mines.
             Along with being other people, I am a writer, dancer, piercer, filmaker, photographer,
              and caring friend. Sometimes I associate with being human, but that debatable. I also
              am learning krav maga, stage combat and Trapeze. My moms tolds and I quote "black people dont do that shit" well mom
              Im only alien. Follow me on my weird journey through life and I will try to keep you
              entertained. </p>
